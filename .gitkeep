# .gitkeep files to maintain directory structure in Git

# Create these empty .gitkeep files in the following directories:

# data/processed/.gitkeep
# This directory stores processed datasets after cleaning and transformation

# data/external/.gitkeep  
# This directory stores external data sources and downloads

# models/.gitkeep
# This directory stores trained machine learning models

# reports/figures/.gitkeep
# This directory stores generated plots and visualizations

# logs/.gitkeep
# This directory stores application and analysis logs

# scripts/outputs/.gitkeep
# This directory stores outputs from analysis scripts

# tests/.gitkeep
# This directory will store unit tests and test files

# docs/.gitkeep
# This directory stores additional documentation

# notebooks/.gitkeep (if needed later)
# This directory would store Jupyter notebooks

# Create these files by running:
# 
# touch data/processed/.gitkeep
# touch data/external/.gitkeep
# touch models/.gitkeep
# touch reports/figures/.gitkeep  
# touch logs/.gitkeep
# touch scripts/outputs/.gitkeep
# touch tests/.gitkeep
# touch docs/.gitkeep

# Or use this script to create all at once:

import os
from pathlib import Path

directories = [
    'data/processed',
    'data/external', 
    'models',
    'reports/figures',
    'logs',
    'scripts/outputs',
    'tests',
    'docs'
]

for directory in directories:
    # Create directory if it doesn't exist
    Path(directory).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Create .gitkeep file
    gitkeep_file = Path(directory) / '.gitkeep'
    gitkeep_file.touch()
    
    print(f"Created {gitkeep_file}")

print("âœ… All .gitkeep files created successfully!")
